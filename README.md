# 3DGraphicsOn2D

The code does not use any 3D-graphics package or 3D-graphics library.
The assessment has been attempted in Python3 on Jupyter Notebook Environment.
Part1 and Part2 are attached in two different files with extension ‘.py’ .

I have used the pygame library (2D-graphics library) to display the graphics. Thus, it must be installed for the code to run. Comments have been added all through the code for easy understanding.
